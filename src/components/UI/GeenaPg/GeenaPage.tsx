        companion, that I had dreamed of and waited to have for 7 years of my
        childhood/teenage years. She&apos;d been by my side for many years
        (since 2010) and had assisted to many of my greatest memories,
        adventures and life changing events. In other words, she&apos;s seen me
        at my best and at my worst. I must say, my 20s wouldn&apos;t have been
        the same without her.

        She was a real star, since a lot of people from my life met her from all
        over the world. She was known at my college, at my dance school, dog
        shows (sheâ€™s Champion in 4 countries, International Show Champion, Club
        Winner etc.) and my travel companion in many of my adventures in
        Romania. She was also the{" "}
